        Q1. What type of inheritance are you using?-->Multiple inheritance
        Q2. Which mode of inheritance are you using?--> class HybridCalculator : public SimpleCalculator, public ScientificCalculator
        Q3. Creat an object of HybridCalculator and display results of single and scientific calculator.
        Q4. How is code reusability implemented?
